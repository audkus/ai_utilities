Dependency injection is a design pattern in which objects are passed their dependencies rather than creating them internally. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code, as dependencies can be easily swapped out or mocked for testing purposes. By injecting dependencies, classes become more modular and maintainable, as they are not tightly coupled to specific implementations. This also promotes the principles of separation of concerns and inversion of control, making code easier to understand and modify.
