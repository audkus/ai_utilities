# PyPI Publishing via Trusted Publishing
#
# PURPOSE: Automatically publish packages to PyPI when version tags are pushed
# TRIGGER: Git tags matching pattern v* (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.0.0b1, v1.0.0rc1)
# AUTHENTICATION: Uses PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) - no secrets stored
# PUBLISHES: Both stable releases and pre-releases
